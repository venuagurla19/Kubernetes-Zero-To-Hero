# Kubernetes Deployment Guide

Welcome to the Kubernetes Deployment Guide repository. This guide provides documentation and best practices for managing applications on Kubernetes using various resources like Deployments, Services, Pods, and Replication Controllers.

## Introduction

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This guide aims to help you understand and effectively use Kubernetes resources to deploy and manage your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A working Kubernetes cluster. You can set up one using [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) or a cloud-based Kubernetes service.
- The `kubectl` command-line tool configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.

## Deployments

Deployments are a powerful way to manage the deployment of applications on Kubernetes. They allow you to define the desired state of your application, and Kubernetes takes care of maintaining that state. Document your deployments here.

## Services

Services enable you to expose your applications to the network or other parts of your cluster. They provide networking features like load balancing. Document your services here.

## Pods

Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. While Deployments often manage pods, you can also create and manage pods directly. Document your pod management here.

## Replication Controllers

Replication Controllers ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running. They help maintain the desired level of application availability. Document your use of replication controllers here.
